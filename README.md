# Symbolic Regression from Scratch with Python

This repository contains Python code to accompany the article _Symbolic Regression from Scratch with Python_.
The code implements a basic symbolic regression system which uses genetic programming to
find a program that describes the relationship between some features and a target variable.
More specifically, this code uses the ["Auto MPG Data Set" from UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto%2BMPG)
to find a relationship between vehicle characteristics and **mpg** (miles per gallon).

## Depedencies
- Pandas
- auto-mpg.data

## Usage

```python symbolic_regression.py```

## Setup/Installation
```
pip install python
wget http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data
```
